# Movie Dataset Analysis

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing a dataset of movies. It demonstrates data cleaning, statistical analysis, and data visualization techniques using pandas, numpy, and other Python libraries.

## Project Description

The Python script processes a dataset containing details about movies, such as titles, directors, actors, genres, revenues, and ratings. It performs a series of analyses to extract insights like the highest-rated movie, average revenues, the most common actor, and more. The aim is to showcase data manipulation capabilities in Python for meaningful data analysis.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values and cleans up column names for easier access.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates various statistics, such as the highest-rated movie, average revenue, and the number of movies released per year.
- **Insight Extraction**: Identifies the most common actor, the year with the highest average rating, and the percentage increase in movies over a decade.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system. You'll also need to install the following libraries:
